## Solving 4x4 SLAE
### Overview
This [website](https://thedeiw.github.io/SLAE-4x4-Jakobi-method-/) showcases a tool for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (SLAE) of size 4x4 using numerical methods. It provides an intuitive interface for inputting data and exploring mathematical concepts.

The tool computes Alpha and Beta matrices, using them to solve the SLAE with both the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods. This approach highlights iterative techniques in numerical computation.
### Reason for creation
Created as part of a lab assignment for the "Numerical Methods" course, the project helps students learn theoretical principles and test them using personalized input scenarios.

_Button "Input" fills all fields with numbers given by your own variant._
